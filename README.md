# Blockweave Engine

## 📌 Project Description
Blockweave Engine is a lightweight Solidity-based module designed to store and manage structured data entries on the Ethereum blockchain. It demonstrates fundamental smart contract patterns including ownership, event logging, and CRUD-like operations.

## 🌍 Project Vision
The goal of Blockweave Engine is to provide a modular, extensible component that developers can integrate into larger decentralized applications. Over time, this engine can evolve into a powerful data-layer abstraction for Web3 systems requiring immutable, timestamped records.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Add Entries:** Store timestamped data entries on-chain.
- **Update Entries:** Modify entries securely with ownership restrictions.
- **Retrieve Entries:** Access structured data with a simple interface.
- **Event Logging:** Transparent blockchain events for all state-changing actions.
- **Ownership Control:** Admin-only functions to maintain system integrity.

## 🚀 Future Scope
- Support for **role-based access control** (RBAC).
- A **versioning system** for historical entry tracking.
- Integration with **off-chain data oracles**.
- A **modular plugin architecture** for advanced storage types.
- UI components for human-friendly interaction with stored data.
